z <- c(1.1, 9, 3.14) #creation of a vector.

#vector can be used also fot operation like z*2+100 --> First, R multiplied each of the three elements in z by 2. Then it added 100 to each element to get the result you see above

#Other common arithmetic operators are `+`, `-`, `/`, and `^` (where x^2 means 'x squared'). To take the square root, use the sqrt() function and
#to take the absolute value, use the abs() function.
